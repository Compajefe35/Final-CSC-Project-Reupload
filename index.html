                <h2>The Invention of the Rubik's Cube</h2>
                <p>The Rubik's Cube was invented in 1974 by Ernő Rubik, a Hungarian architect and professor of architecture. Originally called the "Magic Cube," it was created to help teach students about spatial relationships.</p>

                <h2>Early Prototypes</h2>
                <p>Ernő Rubik invented the Rubik's Cube in 1974 as a teaching tool to help students understand spatial relationships. Originally called the "Magic Cube" it consisted of interlocking smaller cubes that could be rotated independently. Though not initially designed as a toy, it quickly became a global sensation after being rebranded as the Rubik's Cube in 1980.</p>

                <h2>How it evolved</h2>
                <p>Over time the Rubik's Cube's design evolved for better functionality. Initially it had a wooden core and stickered surfaces later replaced by a plastic core and durable stickers. In the 1990s stickerless cubes became popular with colors molded into the plastic. Design improvements such as smoother turning mechanisms, adjustable tensions, and magnetic systems, have enhanced speedcubing making it faster and more durable for both casual and competitive solvers.</p>
